	I'm not sure I even know where to begin. I've been a painter and an illustrator as far back as I can remember. I've been around design my entire life, both my dad & grandfather are designers, Some of my earliest memories are of playing in my dad's studio, handcut page mockups, trips to the typesetter, and drawing on top of proof sheets. This was obviously a huge influence. Next, in no particular order, are skateboarding, music, and graffiti. I couldn't possibly know where to begin in how these things shaped who I am today, and I wont even attempt it. You've got the basic.

	<!-- I feel really lucky to have grown up around art & design, my dad & grandfathers are both designers. --> I grew up around art and design. Along the way I became greatly influenced by skateboarding, music, video games & graffiti. Before the internet, but barely. (yup...old)
